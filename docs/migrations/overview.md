# Migrations overview

Quma includes a migration runner for SQL, template, and PHP migrations. It discovers migration files from the directories configured on `Connection`, sorts them by file name, and records applied migrations in a database table.

## Configure migration directories

Configure migration directories with `Connection::migrations()`.

```php
$conn = (new Connection(
    'sqlite:' . __DIR__ . '/app.sqlite',
    __DIR__ . '/sql',
))->migrations(__DIR__ . '/migrations');
```

You can also pass a list of directories.

```php
$conn = (new Connection(
    'sqlite:' . __DIR__ . '/app.sqlite',
    __DIR__ . '/sql',
))->migrations([
    __DIR__ . '/migrations/core',
    __DIR__ . '/migrations/project',
]);
```

For flat lists, later entries take precedence when Quma resolves the internal directory list.

## Supported migration file types

Quma loads these migration types:

- `.sql` for static SQL
- `.tpql` for PHP-rendered SQL
- `.php` for custom migration logic

Static placeholders are supported in `.sql` and `.tpql` migrations. They are not processed in `.php` migrations.

## Naming and ordering

Quma sorts migrations by file name, not by full path. A timestamp prefix is the easiest way to keep the order clear.

Typical file names look like this:

```text
250320-101500-create-users.sql
250320-101700-add-indexes.tpql
250320-102000-backfill-data.php
```

## Driver-specific migration files

You can scope a migration to one driver by including the driver in brackets in the file name.

```text
250320-103000-fix-defaults-[sqlite].sql
250320-103000-fix-defaults-[pgsql].sql
250320-103000-fix-defaults-[mysql].sql
```

Quma only applies the file that matches the current driver.

## Running migrations from the CLI

Quma exposes a `migrations` command through `Duon\Quma\Commands::get()`.

Without `--apply`, the command never mutates the database. SQLite and PostgreSQL run the batch inside a transaction and roll it back. MySQL shows a plan only because Quma cannot safely roll back a full MySQL migration batch.

```bash
php your-cli-entry.php db:migrations
```

To actually commit the changes, add `--apply`.

```bash
php your-cli-entry.php db:migrations --apply
```

## Migrations table

Before applying migrations, Quma checks whether the migrations table exists. For supported drivers, the `migrations` command creates it automatically when needed.

By default, the metadata table uses:

- table: `migrations`
- migration column: `migration`
- applied column: `applied`

You can customize these names on `Connection`.

```php
$conn
    ->migrationTable('quma_migrations')
    ->migrationColumns('version', 'executed_at');
```

Quma uses the configured table and column names when it creates the metadata table, reads applied migrations, and records new migrations.

For flat migrations and the `default` namespace, Quma records the migration file base name, for example `250320-101500-create-users.sql`. For non-default namespaces, Quma records `namespace:basename`, for example `billing:250320-101500-create-users.sql`.

## Dry run and transaction behavior

Transaction behavior depends on the driver.

- SQLite: transactional
- PostgreSQL: transactional
- MySQL: non-transactional in Quma's migration runner

For SQLite and PostgreSQL:

- running `migrations` without `--apply` shows what would happen and rolls back
- an error rolls back the whole batch

For MySQL:

- running `migrations` without `--apply` lists the pending migrations and does not execute, render, require, create a metadata table, or record anything
- running `migrations --apply` applies migrations directly because there is no rollback path in the migration runner
- successful migrations remain applied before a later error

## Empty migrations

If a migration file exists but renders or contains only whitespace, Quma skips it and prints a warning.

## SQL migrations

A `.sql` migration is executed directly after static placeholders have been substituted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [::prefix::]users (
    id integer primary key,
    email text not null
);
```

## Template migrations

A `.tpql` migration is a PHP template that must render SQL. Quma substitutes static placeholders in the literal SQL part before rendering the PHP template. The query template cache configured with `Connection::cache()` does not apply to migrations.

Inside migration templates, Quma makes these variables available:

- `$driver`
- `$db`
- `$conn`

Example:

```php
<?php if ($driver === 'pgsql') : ?>
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN created_at timestamp with time zone;
<?php else : ?>
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN created_at text;
<?php endif ?>
```

As with query templates, do not put static placeholders inside PHP code blocks or generate them from PHP output.

## PHP migrations

A `.php` migration must return an object that implements `Duon\Quma\MigrationInterface`.

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Duon\Quma\Environment;
use Duon\Quma\MigrationInterface;

return new class () implements MigrationInterface {
    public function run(Environment $env): void
    {
        $env->db->execute('CREATE TABLE example (id integer primary key)')->run();
    }
};
```

See [PHP migrations](php-migrations.md) for the full interface and environment details.

## Namespaces

If you need multiple independent migration sets, use namespaced migration directories. See [Migration namespaces](namespaces.md).
