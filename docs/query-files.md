# Query files

Quma organizes queries in folders and resolves them at runtime. The folder name becomes a property on `Database`, and the file name becomes the query name.

## Basic mapping

Given this directory structure:

```text
sql/
  users/
    byId.sql
    list.sql
  reports/
    activeUsers.sql
```

Quma resolves the files like this:

- `sql/users/byId.sql` -> `$db->users->byId()`
- `sql/users/list.sql` -> `$db->users->list()`
- `sql/reports/activeUsers.sql` -> `$db->reports->activeUsers()`

If the folder does not exist, Quma throws `RuntimeException` with `The SQL folder does not exist: ...`.

If the script file does not exist, Quma throws `RuntimeException` with `SQL script does not exist`.

## Supported query file types

Quma looks for query files in this order:

1. `<name>.sql`
2. `<name>.tpql`

Use `.sql` for static SQL. Use `.tpql` for PHP-rendered SQL templates.

## Static placeholders

Use static placeholders when a query needs trusted configuration fragments such as schema names or table prefixes.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM [::prefix::]nodes
WHERE published = :published;
```

Configure replacements on `Connection` with `placeholders()`.

```php
$conn = new Connection(
    'pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=app',
    __DIR__ . '/sql',
)->placeholders([
    'all' => ['prefix' => ''],
    'pgsql' => ['prefix' => 'cms.'],
    'mysql' => ['prefix' => 'cms_'],
]);
```

Quma resolves static placeholders from `all` and then overlays the active PDO driver. Driver-specific values override `all`, including empty strings.

Static placeholders are raw SQL text. Quma does not quote or escape them. Use them only for trusted configuration, never for request or user input. Keep runtime values in PDO placeholders such as `:published` or `?`.

Static placeholder names must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_.:-]*`, so names such as `prefix`, `schema.name`, `tenant-prefix`, and `cms:prefix` are valid. Unknown or malformed static placeholders throw an exception that includes the source file, line, column, and active driver.

Quma substitutes static placeholders when a file is first loaded by a `Database` instance and caches the compiled source for that instance. Direct SQL passed to `Database::execute()` is not processed. For hot `.tpql` query files, you can also configure a persistent template cache with `Connection::cache()`.

## Configure SQL directories

The second `Connection` argument defines where Quma looks for SQL folders.

### Single directory

```php
$conn = new Connection(
    'sqlite:' . __DIR__ . '/app.sqlite',
    __DIR__ . '/sql',
);
```

### Flat list of directories

```php
$conn = new Connection(
    'sqlite:' . __DIR__ . '/app.sqlite',
    [
        __DIR__ . '/sql/default',
        __DIR__ . '/sql/feature-overrides',
    ],
);
```

Quma searches the resolved directory list from first to last. For flat lists, later entries are searched first, so in the example above `sql/feature-overrides` takes precedence over `sql/default`.

## Driver-specific directories

You can scope directories to a PDO driver with `sqlite`, `mysql`, `pgsql`, and `all` keys.

```php
$conn = new Connection(
    'pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=app',
    [
        'pgsql' => __DIR__ . '/sql/pgsql',
        'all' => [
            __DIR__ . '/sql/common',
            __DIR__ . '/sql/legacy',
        ],
    ],
);
```

For associative driver maps, Quma resolves driver-specific entries before `all` entries.

## Mixing directory configs

You can also mix plain directories, nested lists, and driver maps.

```php
$conn = new Connection(
    'sqlite:' . __DIR__ . '/app.sqlite',
    [
        [
            'sqlite' => __DIR__ . '/sql/sqlite',
            'all' => __DIR__ . '/sql/common',
        ],
        __DIR__ . '/sql/project',
    ],
);
```

This is useful when you want one shared base tree and a small set of overrides.

## Shadowing and precedence

Quma stops at the first matching file it finds.

That means:

- the first matching directory wins
- driver-specific directories can override shared directories
- in flat lists, later entries override earlier entries

A common pattern is:

```text
sql/
  common/
    users/
      byId.sql
  sqlite/
    users/
      byId.sql
```

With a SQLite connection, the SQLite-specific `byId.sql` can override the common version.

## Access scripts as objects

`$db->users->byId` returns a `Script` object. You can store it and call it later.

```php
$byId = $db->users->byId;
$user = $byId(42)->one();
```

This is equivalent to `$db->users->byId(42)->one()`.

## Add directories later

You can prepend more SQL directories after construction.

```php
$conn->addSql([
    'sqlite' => __DIR__ . '/sql/sqlite-overrides',
]);
```

Added directories are searched before the directories that were already configured.
