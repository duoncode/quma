# Quma

Quma is a no-ORM database library for PHP. You keep SQL in files, execute it through a small PDO-backed API, and can layer on PHP-powered templates and migrations when plain SQL is not enough.

## Who it is for

Quma fits projects that want to:

- keep SQL visible instead of hiding it behind an ORM
- organize queries by feature or table in folders
- support multiple PDO drivers with a shared query layout
- ship database migrations alongside application code

## Core concepts

Quma revolves around a small set of objects:

- `Connection` holds the DSN, SQL directories, migration directories, and fetch mode.
- `Database` opens the PDO connection and is the main entry point.
- `Folder` maps a SQL folder such as `users/` to `$db->users`.
- `Script` wraps a `.sql` or `.tpql` file.
- `Query` binds parameters and executes the prepared statement.

In practice, a file like `sql/users/byId.sql` becomes `$db->users->byId()`.

## Feature overview

Quma currently supports:

- static SQL files with positional or named parameters
- static `[::name::]` placeholders for trusted driver-aware configuration fragments
- PHP-rendered SQL templates in `.tpql` files
- multiple SQL directories with driver-specific overrides
- direct execution of ad-hoc SQL through `Database::execute()`
- explicit database lifecycle helpers such as `connected()`, `disconnect()`, `reconnect()`, `ping()`, and `reset()` for long-running PHP processes
- migrations written in `.sql`, `.tpql`, or `.php`
- CLI helpers for creating and applying migrations
